# 🌲 Predicting High-Risk Deforestation Zones in Alberta

This project is a Streamlit-based dashboard that visualizes and predicts deforestation risk across a region in Alberta, Canada. Using satellite-derived features like NDVI, Dynamic World land cover probabilities, and topographic data, it allows users to explore historical trends and forecast deforestation events using machine learning models (XGBoost and LSTM).
